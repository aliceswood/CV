## Alice Wood

Hey there, welcome to my little corner of GitHub!

Before diving into the tech world and joining [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy), my background was in HR and Hospitality. My years of customer-facing roles really have ingrained in me the importance of communication, empathy, and adaptability. I am excited to bring these skills with me as I get stuck into my journey as a Software Developer and contribute to projects and companies that really want to make a difference.

In HR I experienced many difficult or inefficient systems which inspired my move into tech, to help make other people’s jobs easier, more productive, and if anything, less infuriating! 

After really enjoying the front end side of things on the Makers course, I am currently working on a project to learn Next.js and develop my CSS skills further. I really enjoy the creativity and innovation that front end development can bring to a project and I can't wait to build my skills and kick start my career!

## Experience

**Makers Academy** (March - June 2023)
_Student Software Engineer_

- A highly selective 16-week intensive software development bootcamp with focus on 'learning how to learn' as well as OOP, TDD, Agile Working Practices, Pair Programming, and Emotional Intelligence.

- Learned and developed agile practices such as working in sprints which included the use of daily stand-ups and end of sprint retrospectives. This helped the team work cohesively and effectively and it aided feature delivery. 

- Developed a Test Driven Development process using Rspec, Jest, and Cypress for end to end testing. This enabled me to produce reliable code in order to fulfil client requests. The TDD process also helped make incremental progress when overcoming challenging tasks and bugs.

- The course is fast paced by nature and this required new languages to be picked up quickly and efficently. On the course we worked in Ruby and Javascript which has shaped my learning post course as I am creating a new project from scratch as I learn Next.js and improve my CSS skills.

- We attended workshops which gave me the opportunity to develop my emotional intelligence further. Topics included giving and receiving feedback, empathy, and how to effectively work in teams of developers.

## Skills

- **Attention to Detail:** As an HR professional, a key aspect of my role included managing sensitive employee data from performance reviews to sickness absence. Attention to detail is also crucial in software development, where even a small error in code can have significant consequences - which I have very much learned the hard way!

- **Adaptability:** There were daily challenges working in HR - these could range from dealing with difficult employee sitations to picking up new systems or procedures. Similarly, the tech world is an ever-evolving field, and being adaptable and willing to learn new technologies and programming languages are essential skills.

- **Communication:** I learned how to adapt my style of communication depending on who I am speaking to. This improved my ability for active listening, giving and receiving feedback, and discussing ideas, all of which are key skills for teamwork and collaboration. 

- **Problem Solving:** A lot of the work within HR is driven by problem solving, for example working with managers to increase team morale or working as a mediator to help resolve conflicts. Often HR projects often need some thinking outside of the box in order to find the solution. So far in my journey as a Software Developer, I have definitely seen the importance of looking at the bigger picture and thinking laterally to solve a challenge.

- **Confidentiality:** In my roles in HR and Hospitality, I was responsible for handling sensitive employee information and ensuring its confidentiality. This has instilled in me a deep understanding of the importance of data privacy and the ability to maintain confidentiality in all aspects of my work.
